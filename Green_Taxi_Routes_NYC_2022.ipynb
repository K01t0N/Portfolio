This project tries to gain some insight into different combinations of routes and where a lot of the green taxis go.\n\n## What data will be used\n\nThe dataset that will be used is the `new_york_taxi_trips` dataset from the bigquery-public-data database. The data will be queried through BigQuery.\n\nThese are the tables and columns that will be used for this analysis:\n\n**tlc_green_trips_2022:**\n\n`pickup_location_id` - the zone number that the passenger(s) started their trip\n\n`dropoff_location_id` - the zone number that the passenger(s) ended their trip\n\n**taxi_zone_geom:**\n\n`zone_id` - the number for every taxi zone (this is the same value as pickup_location_id and dropoff_location_id, so it can be joined between tables.)\n\n`zone_name` - the name of every taxi zone\n\n`borough` - the borough that the taxi zone is in\n\n\n## Cleaning the Data\n\n\n### Identifying the Taxi Zones \n\nThese are the four columns of “taxi zones” that will be checked:\n\n**tlc_green_trips_2022 table:**\n\n`pickup_location_id`\n`dropoff_location_id`\n\n**taxi_zone_geom table:**\n\n`zone_id`\n`zone_name`\n\n\n**tlc_green_trips_2022**\n\nChecking for values in the `pickup_location_id` column:",

Zones 56 and 57 are both Corona in the Queens borough, and 103, 104, and 105 make up Liberty Island, Ellis Island, and the Governor’s Island, respectively (see references at end).

I did this twice, so I could have one column listing the routes between specific taxi zones, and another column listing the routes between the boroughs. I used aliases for all four join statements so I could join columns from the same tables four times.\n\nThen, I aggregated the `pickup_location_id` with `COUNT` to find out which trips were taken the most often in 2022. I am only doing a `COUNT` of pickups because the `COUNT` of pickups and dropoffs is the same, creating a redundant column. To get a percentage for each route out of all the different routes, I used the `OVER` function.\n\nBy grouping the pickup and dropoff zones together, I was able to calculate the frequency of every possible combination of pickup and dropoff taxi zones in NYC.",

The top two routes listed, between the north and south parts of East Harlem, make up more than 4.2% of all possible route combinations between zones. Taking a bigger picture look, the `borough_route` column shows that most of the high frequent routes take place within Manhattan.\n\nOne limitation of this study is that I only looked at a table of trips for green taxis in the year 2022. It is very plausible that tables containing data about the yellow taxis, or tables of the green taxis from previous years, could contain different information and insights.\n\n## References\n\nThis is list of all NYC Taxi Zones, made by user fivethirtyeight:\nhttps://github.com/fivethirtyeight/uber-tlc-foil-response/blob/master/uber-trip-data/taxi-zone-lookup.csv\n\nThis is a map of all NYC Taxi Zones by cityofnewyork.us:\nhttps://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/NYC-Taxi-Zones/d3c5-ddgc",
